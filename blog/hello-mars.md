Hey! My name is Guillermo but all my friends call me **Guille** and I'm 29. I'm going to start this awesome adventure and share to whoever will read these lines all what I'm learning at work, with my personal projects and from the internet! You can find me as `guillermotti` in social networks and I'll be happy to talk to you about anything!

At the moment of writing this I'm working at [empathy.co](empathy.co), the best company I've ever worked for. After 2 years and a half I learned a lot about cloud, infrastructure as code, scripting, containers, Kubernetes, DevOps, CI/CD, GitOps and many many more things.

Before working at empathy.co I've been working in *DXC Technology* (formerly *CSC*) and *Indra* with mostly Angular and the previous AngularJS so I have some background on JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS and frontend development. Also I've been working with Java for a while at my intership but I don't remember almost anything about it.

In my personal time I've been playing a lot with serverless development and cloud before joining empathy.co. I gave a try to Firebase, AWS Amplify and CI/CD cloud providers like Circle CI to build interesting websites like [feta.es](feta.es).

Talking about my personal interests, I enjoy travelling to anywhere with my girlfriend In√©s üß°, celebrating with my family, drinking üçª with my friends and listening to electronic music üëΩ.

Also I've been playing *football* (soccer) since I started to walk. But unfortunately I broke my knees 4 times (ACL and meniscus), the left knee once and the right knee 3 times. All my dreams when I was a kid for being a professional football player were also broken. But I'm alive yet and ready to break once again if it's necessary. Currently I'm still playing football ‚öΩÔ∏è, skiing ‚õ∑ and skating üõπ. I love the risk!

That's basically me!

My idea is to write at least once per week. Let's see if I can get those numbers. Stay tuned! üöÄ
