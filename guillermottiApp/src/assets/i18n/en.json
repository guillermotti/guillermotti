I have a great capacity for learning and I'm easily comfortable in work groups. I consider myself responsible and although I am not an expert in something concrete, I have the basic notions of many things, which helps me to learn nimbly. I like competitiveness and I think that with humility and ambition everything is much simpler. I enjoy helping others and sharing the knowledge I know.",
