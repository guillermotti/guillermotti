  "_DESCRIPTION": "Since childhood, I compete responsibly my hobbies with my education and now also with work. Always eager to learn and discover new goals. I have a great capacity for learning and I'm easily comfortable in work groups.

I like competitiveness and I think that with humility and ambition everything is much simpler. I enjoy helping others and sharing the knowledge I know.",
